  aboutMe: 'I\'m a Full-Stack developer with an interest in all areas of the development lifecycle seeing projects through from inception to deployment following with on-going development. Utilising my skills in the areas of Frontend and Backend Web Development, CI/CD, Cloud Service Providers, Testing and Agile Practices I rapidly build and iterate on ideas using a number of approaches until I find the one the best solves the problem at hand. Having worked with large companies such as IBM and Telstra I\'m always ready to tackle the next big problem with a smile!',
