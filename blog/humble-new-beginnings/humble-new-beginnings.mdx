So this is the first post of my new blog on my new personal website utilising Gatsby and Netlify. I chose Gatsby due to the praise it constantly receives for empowering developers to build blazingly fast websites with React, now having used it for my own personal website I must admit I'm incredibly impressed.

Using Gatsby I've setup a static blogging website which I will attempt to update periodically with findings that I uncover through my day to day development and debugging. In addition I will also be backfilling any of my old findings that I have been trying to keep in my head for some time so I can use this blog as a reference.

Whilst blogging isn't my strong suit and I typically don't keep them around for long, I'm going to make an effort this year to create posts and hopefully create something nice.
